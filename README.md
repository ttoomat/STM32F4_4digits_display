# 4 digit display project

I try to work with I2C using only CMSIS.

The goal is: two 4 digit displays, one is counting down from 100h (hh:mm), second display is simple stopwatch (mm:ss). Plus there'd be a stop button. Later I'll add writing data to FLASH every second or only when power is gone (then a battery is needed).
